# easy-rscp-js

easy-rscp is an INOFFICIAL library written in Typescript (fully JS compatible) for accessing E3DC home power stations.

E3DC is a brand of HagerEnergy Gmbh ([website](https://www.e3dc.com/)). I have nothing to do with the company, except that I own a home power plant from E3DC and wanted to include it in my SmartHome. This "desire" gave birth to easy-rscp.

This library is a port of [easy-rscp](https://github.com/jnk-cons/easy-rscp). Most of the classes and principles from easy-rscp also work here.

## Getting started

a getting started guide is currently under development and will be released soon.
